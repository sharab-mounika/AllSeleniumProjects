/*First of all there is no concept of global variables in java. There are two types of variables in java, one is associated with the class it self and second one is related to objects created of that class.

When you declare a variable static it will be associated with the class (of first type). Which means jvm will create only one copy of that variable in memory, no matter how many objects you create of that class. In addition to that you can access this variable using class name, so no need to instantiate the class to access the static variable.
On the other hand, any other variables declared in class definition will be considered as instance variables and jvm will create new copy of those variables for every objects created for that class. One have to instantiate the class and create object to access this type of variables.

public class Student { 
    public static int totalStudents = 50; 
    //this is static variable, so it is of first type 
 
    String name; 
    String address; 
    // these are local variable or we can say instance variables. These are different for every object created of student. 
}  */
